# Loopmania
The game world in this program contains a looped path made up of image tiles, where the Character automatically moves clockwise through the path from position to position, starting from the Hero's Castle. Along the way, the Character will encounter buildings, enemies, gold, health potions, and other items. The movement of enemies along the path depends on the type of enemy. The Human Player, who is distinct from the Character, plays the game to help the Character win by creating buildings, equipping items, purchasing and selling items, consuming health potions, and pausing the game.

When the Character comes under attack from an enemy on the path, a battle is automatically initiated, involving nearby enemies and the Character. The Human Player cannot intervene during a battle. If the Character defeats all enemies in the battle, rewards such as cards, experience, gold, and equipment can be obtained. Otherwise, if the Character is killed, the game ends and the Human Player loses. Some enemies, such as vampires, have a larger support radius and will join the battle even if the Character is outside their battle radius.

The game is won by completing the set goals. The program is written entirely in Java, with JavaFX being used for the frontend. More details on the buildings, enemies, and items can be found in their respective tables.
